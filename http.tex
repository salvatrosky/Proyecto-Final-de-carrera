\subsection{Â¿Que es el protocolo HTTP?}
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
   self-descriptive message payloads for flexible interaction with
   network-based hypertext information systems.
   HTTP is a generic interface protocol for information systems.  It is
   designed to hide the details of how a service is implemented by
   presenting a uniform interface to clients that is independent of the
   types of resources provided.  Likewise, servers do not need to be
   aware of each client's purpose: an HTTP request can be considered in
   isolation rather than being associated with a specific type of client
   or a predetermined sequence of application steps.  The result is a
   protocol that can be used effectively in many different contexts and
   for which implementations can evolve independently over time.
  
   One consequence of this flexibility is that the protocol cannot be
   defined in terms of what occurs behind the interface.  Instead, we
   are limited to defining the syntax of communication, the intent of
   received communication, and the expected behavior of recipients.  If
   the communication is considered in isolation, then successful actions
   ought to be reflected in corresponding changes to the observable
   interface provided by servers.  However, since multiple clients might
   act in parallel and perhaps at cross-purposes, we cannot require that
   such changes be observable beyond the scope of a single response.
   
\subsection{Arquitectura}
HTTP was created for the World Wide Web (WWW) architecture and has
evolved over time to support the scalability needs of a worldwide
hypertext system.  Much of that architecture is reflected in the
terminology and syntax productions used to define HTTP.
\subsubsection{Client/Server Messaging}
HTTP is a stateless request/response protocol that operates by
exchanging messages across a reliable transport- or
session-layer "connection".  An HTTP "client" is a
program that establishes a connection to a server for the purpose of
sending one or more HTTP requests.  An HTTP "server" is a program
that accepts connections in order to service HTTP requests by sending
HTTP responses.
Most HTTP communication consists of a retrieval request (GET) for a
representation of some resource identified by a URI.  In the simplest
case, this might be accomplished via a single bidirectional
connection (===) between the user agent (UA) and the origin
server (O).

         request   ->
    UserAgent ======================================= Origin server
                                <   response

A client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a request
message, beginning with a request-line that includes a method, URI,
and protocol version, followed by header fields
containing request modifiers, client information, and representation
metadata, an empty line to indicate the end of the
header section, and finally a message body containing the payload
body (if any, Section 3.3).
A server responds to a client's request by sending one or more HTTP
   response messages, each beginning with a status line that includes
   the protocol version, a success or error code, and textual reason
   phrase (Section 3.1.2), possibly followed by header fields containing
   server information, resource metadata, and representation metadata
   (Section 3.2), an empty line to indicate the end of the header
   section, and finally a message body containing the payload body (if
   any, Section 3.3).
\subsubsection{Ejemplo}
The following example illustrates a typical message exchange for a
GET request (Section 4.3.1 of [RFC7231]) on the URI
"http://www.example.com/hello.txt":

Client request:

  GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
  User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 libcurl/7.16.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7l zlib/1.2.3
  Host: www.example.com
  Accept-Language: en, mi


Server response:

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
  Server: Apache
  Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
  ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
  Accept-Ranges: bytes
  Content-Length: 51
  Vary: Accept-Encoding
  Content-Type: text/plain

  Hello World! My payload includes a trailing CRLF.

  HTTP is defined as a stateless protocol, meaning that each request
   message can be understood in isolation.  Many implementations depend
   on HTTP's stateless design in order to reuse proxied connections or
   dynamically load balance requests across multiple servers.  Hence, a
   server MUST NOT assume that two requests on the same connection are
   from the same user agent unless the connection is secured and
   specific to that agent.  Some non-standard HTTP extensions (e.g.,
   [RFC4559]) have been known to violate this requirement, resulting in
   security and interoperability problems.
\subsection{Formato del mensaje (Mejorar intro)}

All HTTP/1.1 messages consist of a start-line followed by a sequence
of octets in a format similar to the Internet Message Format
[RFC5322]: zero or more header fields (collectively referred to as
the "headers" or the "header section"), an empty line indicating the
end of the header section, and an optional message body.
The normal procedure for parsing an HTTP message is to read the
   start-line into a structure, read each header field into a hash table
   by field name until the empty line, and then use the parsed data to
   determine if a message body is expected.  If a message body has been
   indicated, then it is read as a stream until an amount of octets
   equal to the message body length is read or the connection is closed.

 
\subsubsection{Start Line}
An HTTP message can be either a request from client to server or a
   response from server to client.  Syntactically, the two types of
   message differ only in the start-line, which is either a request-line
   (for requests) or a status-line (for responses), and in the algorithm
   for determining the length of the message body .
   In theory, a client could receive requests and a server could receive
   responses, distinguishing them by their different start-line formats,
   but, in practice, servers are implemented to only expect a request (a
   response is interpreted as an unknown or invalid request method) and
   clients are implemented to only expect a response.

     
\paragraph{Request Line}
A request-line begins with a method token, followed by a single space
   (SP), the request-target, another single space (SP), the protocol
   version, and ends with CRLF.

     (podria ir un grafico)

   The method token indicates the request method to be performed on the
   target resource.  The request method is case-sensitive.


   The request-target identifies the target resource upon which to apply
   the request



  
\paragraph{Status Line}
The first line of a response message is the status-line, consisting
   of the protocol version, a space (SP), the status code, another
   space, a possibly empty textual phrase describing the status code,
   and ending with CRLF.

   (podria ir un grafico)

   The status-code element is a 3-digit integer code describing the
   result of the server's attempt to understand and satisfy the client's
   corresponding request.  The rest of the response message is to be
   interpreted in light of the semantics defined for that status code.
  


\subsubsection {Header Fields}
Each header field consists of a case-insensitive field name followed
by a colon (":"), optional leading whitespace, the field value, and
optional trailing whitespace.

(podria ir un grafico o con un formato mejor)
header-field   = field-name ":" OWS field-value OWS

The field-name token labels the corresponding field-value as having
the semantics defined by that header field.  

\paragraph{Field Extensibility}
Header fields are fully extensible: there is no limit on the
introduction of new field names, each presumably defining new
semantics, nor on the number of header fields used in a given
message.  Existing fields are defined in each part of this
specification and in many other specifications outside this document
set.

New header fields can be defined such that, when they are understood
by a recipient, they might override or enhance the interpretation of
previously defined header fields, define preconditions on request
evaluation, or refine the meaning of responses.

\paragraph{Field Order}
The order in which header fields with differing field names are
   received is not significant.  However, it is good practice to send
   header fields that contain control data first, such as Host on
   requests and Date on responses, so that implementations can decide
   when not to handle a message as early as possible. 


\paragraph{Whitespace}
This specification uses three rules to denote the use of linear
whitespace: OWS (optional whitespace), RWS (required whitespace), and
BWS ("bad" whitespace).

The OWS rule is used where zero or more linear whitespace octets
might appear.  
The RWS rule is used when at least one linear whitespace octet is
required to separate field tokens.  

The BWS rule is used where the grammar allows optional whitespace
only for historical reasons. 

\paragraph{Field Parsing}
Messages are parsed using a generic algorithm, independent of the
individual header field names.  The contents within a given field
value are not parsed until a later stage of message interpretation
(usually after the message's entire header section has been
processed).  Consequently, this specification does not use ABNF rules
to define each "Field-Name: Field Value" pair, as was done in
previous editions.  Instead, this specification uses ABNF rules that
are named according to each registered field name, wherein the rule
defines the valid grammar for that field's corresponding field values
(i.e., after the field-value has been extracted from the header
section by a generic field parser).

No whitespace is allowed between the header field-name and colon.  In
the past, differences in the handling of such whitespace have led to
security vulnerabilities in request routing and response handling. 


\paragraph{Field Limits }
HTTP does not place a predefined limit on the length of each header
field or on the length of the header section as a whole.  Various 
ad hoc limitations on individual header
field length are found in practice, often depending on the specific
field semantics.


\paragraph{Field Value Components}
(no entiendo, tal vez se puede sacar)
Most HTTP header field values are defined using common syntax
components (token, quoted-string, and comment) separated by
whitespace or specific delimiting characters.  Delimiters are chosen
from the set of US-ASCII visual characters not allowed in a token
%(DQUOTE and "(),/:;<=>?@[\]{}").

  token          = 1*tchar

%  tchar          = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*"
%                 / "+" / "-" / "." / "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~"
                 / DIGIT / ALPHA
                 ; any VCHAR, except delimiters

A string of text is parsed as a single value if it is quoted using
double-quote marks.

  quoted-string  = DQUOTE *( qdtext / quoted-pair ) DQUOTE
  qdtext         = HTAB / SP /%x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E / obs-text
  obs-text       = %x80-FF

Comments can be included in some HTTP header fields by surrounding
the comment text with parentheses.  Comments are only allowed in
fields containing "comment" as part of their field value definition.

  comment        = "(" *( ctext / quoted-pair / comment ) ")"
  ctext          = HTAB / SP / %x21-27 / %x2A-5B / %x5D-7E / obs-text

The backslash octet ("\") can be used as a single-octet quoting
mechanism within quoted-string and comment constructs.  Recipients
that process the value of a quoted-string MUST handle a quoted-pair
as if it were replaced by the octet following the backslash.

  quoted-pair    = "\" ( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / obs-text )

A sender SHOULD NOT generate a quoted-pair in a quoted-string except
where necessary to quote DQUOTE and backslash octets occurring within
that string.  A sender SHOULD NOT generate a quoted-pair in a comment
except where necessary to quote parentheses ["(" and ")"] and
backslash octets occurring within that comment.
\subsubsection{Message Body }
The message body (if any) of an HTTP message is used to carry the
payload body of that request or response.  The message body is
identical to the payload body unless a transfer coding has been
applied.


The rules for when a message body is allowed in a message differ for
requests and responses.

The presence of a message body in a request is signaled by a
Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field.  Request message
framing is independent of method semantics, even if the method does
not define any use for a message body.

The presence of a message body in a response depends on both the
request method to which it is responding and the response status code.  
Responses to the HEAD request method 
never include a message body because the associated
response header fields 
, if present, indicate only what their values would have been if
the request method had been GET (Section 4.3.1 of [RFC7231]). 2xx
(Successful) responses to a CONNECT request method (Section 4.3.6 of
[RFC7231]) switch to tunnel mode instead of having a message body.
All 1xx (Informational), 204 (No Content), and 304 (Not Modified)
responses do not include a message body.  All other responses do
include a message body, although the body might be of zero length.

\paragraph{Transfer-Encoding }

The Transfer-Encoding header field lists the transfer coding names
corresponding to the sequence of transfer codings that have been (or
will be) applied to the payload body in order to form the message
body.  Transfer codings are defined in Section 4.



Transfer-Encoding is analogous to the Content-Transfer-Encoding field
of MIME, which was designed to enable safe transport of binary data
over a 7-bit transport service .  However, safe
transport has a different focus for an 8bit-clean transfer protocol.
In HTTP's case, Transfer-Encoding is primarily intended to accurately
delimit a dynamically generated payload and to distinguish payload
encodings that are only applied for transport efficiency or security
from those that are characteristics of the selected resource.
. 

For example,

  Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked

indicates that the payload body has been compressed using the gzip
coding and then chunked using the chunked coding while forming the
message body.

Unlike Content-Encoding ,
Transfer-Encoding is a property of the message, not of the
representation, and any recipient along the request/response chain
MAY decode the received transfer coding(s) or apply additional
transfer coding(s) to the message body, assuming that corresponding
changes are made to the Transfer-Encoding field-value.  Additional
information about the encoding parameters can be provided by other
header fields not defined by this specification.



Transfer-Encoding was added in HTTP/1.1.  It is generally assumed
that implementations advertising only HTTP/1.0 support will not
understand how to process a transfer-encoded payload. 

\paragraph{Content-Length }
When a message does not have a Transfer-Encoding header field, a
   Content-Length header field can provide the anticipated size, as a
   decimal number of octets, for a potential payload body.  For messages
   that do include a payload body, the Content-Length field-value
   provides the framing information necessary for determining where the
   body (and message) ends.  For messages that do not include a payload
   body, the Content-Length indicates the size of the selected
   representation .

    

\paragraph{Message Body Length }

(no entiendo, ver diferencia con content-length)
The length of a message body is determined by one of the following
(in order of precedence):

1.  Any response to a HEAD request and any response with a 1xx
    (Informational), 204 (No Content), or 304 (Not Modified) status
    code is always terminated by the first empty line after the
    header fields, regardless of the header fields present in the
    message, and thus cannot contain a message body.

2.  Any 2xx (Successful) response to a CONNECT request implies that
    the connection will become a tunnel immediately after the empty
    line that concludes the header fields.  A client MUST ignore any
    Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header fields received in
    such a message.

3.  If a Transfer-Encoding header field is present and the chunked
    transfer coding (Section 4.1) is the final encoding, the message
    body length is determined by reading and decoding the chunked
    data until the transfer coding indicates the data is complete.

    If a Transfer-Encoding header field is present in a response and
    the chunked transfer coding is not the final encoding, the
    message body length is determined by reading the connection until
    it is closed by the server.  If a Transfer-Encoding header field
    is present in a request and the chunked transfer coding is not
    the final encoding, the message body length cannot be determined
    reliably; the server MUST respond with the 400 (Bad Request)
    status code and then close the connection.

    If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a
    Content-Length header field, the Transfer-Encoding overrides the
    Content-Length.  Such a message might indicate an attempt to
    perform request smuggling (Section 9.5) or response splitting
    (Section 9.4) and ought to be handled as an error.  A sender MUST
    remove the received Content-Length field prior to forwarding such
    a message downstream.

4.  If a message is received without Transfer-Encoding and with
    either multiple Content-Length header fields having differing
    field-values or a single Content-Length header field having an
    invalid value, then the message framing is invalid and the
    recipient MUST treat it as an unrecoverable error.  If this is a
    request message, the server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request)
    status code and then close the connection.  If this is a response
    message received by a proxy, the proxy MUST close the connection
    to the server, discard the received response, and send a 502 (Bad
    Gateway) response to the client.  If this is a response message
    received by a user agent, the user agent MUST close the
    connection to the server and discard the received response.

5.  If a valid Content-Length header field is present without
    Transfer-Encoding, its decimal value defines the expected message
    body length in octets.  If the sender closes the connection or
    the recipient times out before the indicated number of octets are
    received, the recipient MUST consider the message to be
    incomplete and close the connection.

6.  If this is a request message and none of the above are true, then
    the message body length is zero (no message body is present).

7.  Otherwise, this is a response message without a declared message
    body length, so the message body length is determined by the
    number of octets received prior to the server closing the
    connection.

Since there is no way to distinguish a successfully completed,
close-delimited message from a partially received message interrupted
by network failure, a server SHOULD generate encoding or
length-delimited messages whenever possible.  The close-delimiting
feature exists primarily for backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0.

A server MAY reject a request that contains a message body but not a
Content-Length by responding with 411 (Length Required).

Unless a transfer coding other than chunked has been applied, a
client that sends a request containing a message body SHOULD use a
valid Content-Length header field if the message body length is known
in advance, rather than the chunked transfer coding, since some
existing services respond to chunked with a 411 (Length Required)
status code even though they understand the chunked transfer coding.
This is typically because such services are implemented via a gateway
that requires a content-length in advance of being called and the
server is unable or unwilling to buffer the entire request before
processing.

A user agent that sends a request containing a message body MUST send
a valid Content-Length header field if it does not know the server
will handle HTTP/1.1 (or later) requests; such knowledge can be in
the form of specific user configuration or by remembering the version
of a prior received response.

If the final response to the last request on a connection has been
completely received and there remains additional data to read, a user
agent MAY discard the remaining data or attempt to determine if that
data belongs as part of the prior response body, which might be the
case if the prior message's Content-Length value is incorrect.  A
client MUST NOT process, cache, or forward such extra data as a
separate response, since such behavior would be vulnerable to cache
poisoning.

\subsection{Security Considerations}
(Agregar una intro)

\subsubsection{Establishing Authority}

HTTP relies on the notion of an authoritative response: a response
that has been determined by (or at the direction of) the authority
identified within the target URI to be the most appropriate response
for that request given the state of the target resource at the time
of response message origination.  Providing a response from a
non-authoritative source, such as a shared cache, is often useful to
improve performance and availability, but only to the extent that the
source can be trusted or the distrusted response can be safely used.

Unfortunately, establishing authority can be difficult.  For example,
phishing is an attack on the user's perception of authority, where
that perception can be misled by presenting similar branding in
hypertext, possibly aided by userinfo obfuscating the authority
component (see Section 2.7.1).  User agents can reduce the impact of
phishing attacks by enabling users to easily inspect a target URI
prior to making an action, by prominently distinguishing (or
rejecting) userinfo when present, and by not sending stored
credentials and cookies when the referring document is from an
unknown or untrusted source.

When a registered name is used in the authority component, the "http"
URI scheme (Section 2.7.1) relies on the user's local name resolution
service to determine where it can find authoritative responses.  This
means that any attack on a user's network host table, cached names,
or name resolution libraries becomes an avenue for attack on
establishing authority.  Likewise, the user's choice of server for
Domain Name Service (DNS), and the hierarchy of servers from which it
obtains resolution results, could impact the authenticity of address
mappings; DNS Security Extensions are one way to
improve authenticity.

Furthermore, after an IP address is obtained, establishing authority
for an "http" URI is vulnerable to attacks on Internet Protocol
routing.


\subsubsection{Risks of Intermediaries}

By their very nature, HTTP intermediaries are men-in-the-middle and,
thus, represent an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks.
Compromise of the systems on which the intermediaries run can result
in serious security and privacy problems.  Intermediaries might have
access to security-related information, personal information about
individual users and organizations, and proprietary information
belonging to users and content providers.  A compromised
intermediary, or an intermediary implemented or configured without
regard to security and privacy considerations, might be used in the
commission of a wide range of potential attacks.

Intermediaries that contain a shared cache are especially vulnerable
to cache poisoning attacks.
Implementers need to consider the privacy and security implications
of their design and coding decisions, and of the configuration
options they provide to operators (especially the default
configuration).

Users need to be aware that intermediaries are no more trustworthy
than the people who run them; HTTP itself cannot solve this problem.

\subsubsection{Attacks via Protocol Element Length}

Because HTTP uses mostly textual, character-delimited fields, parsers
are often vulnerable to attacks based on sending very long (or very
slow) streams of data, particularly where an implementation is
expecting a protocol element with no predefined length.



\subsubsection{Response Splitting}

Response splitting (a.k.a, CRLF injection) is a common technique,
used in various attacks on Web usage, that exploits the line-based
nature of HTTP message framing and the ordered association of
requests to responses on persistent connections [Klein].  This
technique can be particularly damaging when the requests pass through
a shared cache.

Response splitting exploits a vulnerability in servers (usually
within an application server) where an attacker can send encoded data
within some parameter of the request that is later decoded and echoed
within any of the response header fields of the response.  If the
decoded data is crafted to look like the response has ended and a
subsequent response has begun, the response has been split and the
content within the apparent second response is controlled by the
attacker.  The attacker can then make any other request on the same
persistent connection and trick the recipients (including
intermediaries) into believing that the second half of the split is
an authoritative answer to the second request.

For example, a parameter within the request-target might be read by
an application server and reused within a redirect, resulting in the
same parameter being echoed in the Location header field of the
response.  If the parameter is decoded by the application and not
properly encoded when placed in the response field, the attacker can
send encoded CRLF octets and other content that will make the
application's single response look like two or more responses.


\subsubsection{Request Smuggling}

Request smuggling ([Linhart]) is a technique that exploits
differences in protocol parsing among various recipients to hide
additional requests (which might otherwise be blocked or disabled by
policy) within an apparently harmless request.  Like response
splitting, request smuggling can lead to a variety of attacks on HTTP
usage.


\subsubsection{Message Integrity}

HTTP does not define a specific mechanism for ensuring message
integrity, instead relying on the error-detection ability of
underlying transport protocols and the use of length or
chunk-delimited framing to detect completeness.  Additional integrity
mechanisms, such as hash functions or digital signatures applied to
the content, can be selectively added to messages via extensible
metadata header fields.  Historically, the lack of a single integrity
mechanism has been justified by the informal nature of most HTTP
communication.  However, the prevalence of HTTP as an information
access mechanism has resulted in its increasing use within
environments where verification of message integrity is crucial.

User agents are encouraged to implement configurable means for
detecting and reporting failures of message integrity such that those
means can be enabled within environments for which integrity is
necessary.  For example, a browser being used to view medical history
or drug interaction information needs to indicate to the user when
such information is detected by the protocol to be incomplete,
expired, or corrupted during transfer.  Such mechanisms might be
selectively enabled via user agent extensions or the presence of
message integrity metadata in a response.  At a minimum, user agents
ought to provide some indication that allows a user to distinguish
between a complete and incomplete response message (Section 3.4) when
such verification is desired.

\subsubsection{Message Confidentiality}

HTTP relies on underlying transport protocols to provide message
confidentiality when that is desired.  HTTP has been specifically
designed to be independent of the transport protocol, such that it
can be used over many different forms of encrypted connection, with
the selection of such transports being identified by the choice of
URI scheme or within user agent configuration.


\subsection{MÃ©todos del protocolo HTTP}
4.3.1.  GET

   The GET method requests transfer of a current selected representation
   for the target resource.  GET is the primary mechanism of information
   retrieval and the focus of almost all performance optimizations.
   Hence, when people speak of retrieving some identifiable information
   via HTTP, they are generally referring to making a GET request.

   It is tempting to think of resource identifiers as remote file system
   pathnames and of representations as being a copy of the contents of
   such files.  In fact, that is how many resources are implemented 
   .  However, there are
   no such limitations in practice.  The HTTP interface for a resource
   is just as likely to be implemented as a tree of content objects, a
   programmatic view on various database records, or a gateway to other
   information systems.  Even when the URI mapping mechanism is tied to
   a file system, an origin server might be configured to execute the
   files with the request as input and send the output as the
   representation rather than transfer the files directly.  Regardless,
   only the origin server needs to know how each of its resource
   identifiers corresponds to an implementation and how each
   implementation manages to select and send a current representation of
   the target resource in a response to GET.

  

4.3.2.  HEAD

   The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT
   send a message body in the response (i.e., the response terminates at
   the end of the header section).  The server SHOULD send the same
   header fields in response to a HEAD request as it would have sent if
   the request had been a GET, except that the payload header fields
    MAY be omitted.  This method can be used for obtaining
   metadata about the selected representation without transferring the
   representation data and is often used for testing hypertext links for
   validity, accessibility, and recent modification.

   

4.3.3.  POST

   The POST method requests that the target resource process the
   representation enclosed in the request according to the resource's
   own specific semantics.  For example, POST is used for the following
   functions (among others):

   o  Providing a block of data, such as the fields entered into an HTML
      form, to a data-handling process;
      o  Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,
      blog, or similar group of articles;

   o  Creating a new resource that has yet to be identified by the
      origin server; and

   o  Appending data to a resource's existing representation(s).

  


   4.3.4.  PUT

   The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be
   created or replaced with the state defined by the representation
   enclosed in the request message payload.  A successful PUT of a given
   representation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same
   target resource will result in an equivalent representation being
   sent in a 200 (OK) response.  However, there is no guarantee that 
   such a state change will be observable, since the target resource
   might be acted upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be
   subject to dynamic processing by the origin server, before any
   subsequent GET is received.  A successful response only implies that
   the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its processing by
   the origin server.


  
    
    4.3.5.  DELETE
    
       The DELETE method requests that the origin server remove the
       association between the target resource and its current
       functionality.  In effect, this method is similar to the rm command
       in UNIX: it expresses a deletion operation on the URI mapping of the
       origin server rather than an expectation that the previously
       associated information be deleted.
    
      
    
       Relatively few resources allow the DELETE method -- its primary use
       is for remote authoring environments, where the user has some
       direction regarding its effect.  For example, a resource that was
       previously created using a PUT request, or identified via the
       Location header field after a 201 (Created) response to a POST
       request, might allow a corresponding DELETE request to undo those
       actions.  Similarly, custom user agent implementations that implement an authoring function, such as revision control clients using HTTP
       for remote operations, might use DELETE based on an assumption that
       the server's URI space has been crafted to correspond to a version
       repository.
    
      
    
    4.3.6.  CONNECT
    
       The CONNECT method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to
       the destination origin server identified by the request-target and,
       if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding
       of packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed.  Tunnels
       are commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through
       one or more proxies, which can then be secured using TLS (Transport
       Layer Security, ).
    
       CONNECT is intended only for use in requests to a proxy.  
         However, most origin servers do not implement CONNECT.
     
    
       There are significant risks in establishing a tunnel to arbitrary
       servers, particularly when the destination is a well-known or
       reserved TCP port that is not intended for Web traffic.  For example,
       a CONNECT to a request-target of "example.com:25" would suggest that
       the proxy connect to the reserved port for SMTP traffic; if allowed,
       that could trick the proxy into relaying spam email.  Proxies that
       support CONNECT SHOULD restrict its use to a limited set of known
       ports or a configurable whitelist of safe request targets.
    
    
    4.3.7.  OPTIONS
    
       The OPTIONS method requests information about the communication
       options available for the target resource, at either the origin
       server or an intervening intermediary.  This method allows a client
       to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a
       resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a
       resource action.
       An OPTIONS request with an asterisk ("*") as the request-target
    applies to the server in general rather
   than to a specific resource.  Since a server's communication options
   typically depend on the resource, the "*" request is only useful as a
   "ping" or "no-op" type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the
   client to test the capabilities of the server.  For example, this can
   be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 conformance (or lack thereof).

  
   A server generating a successful response to OPTIONS SHOULD send any
   header fields that might indicate optional features implemented by
   the server and applicable to the target resource (e.g., Allow),
   including potential extensions not defined by this specification.
   The response payload, if any, might also describe the communication
   options in a machine or human-readable representation.  A standard
   format for such a representation is not defined by this
   specification, but might be defined by future extensions to HTTP.  A
   server MUST generate a Content-Length field with a value of "0" if no
   payload body is to be sent in the response.

4.3.8.  TRACE

   The TRACE method requests a remote, application-level loop-back of
   the request message.  The final recipient of the request SHOULD
   reflect the message received, excluding some fields described below,
   back to the client as the message body of a 200 (OK) response with a
   Content-Type of "message/http" .  The
   final recipient is either the origin server or the first server to
   receive a Max-Forwards value of zero (0) in the request
  .

   TRACE allows the client to see what is being received at the other
   end of the request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic
   information.  The value of the Via header field  is of particular interest, since it acts as a trace of the
   request chain.  Use of the Max-Forwards header field allows the
   client to limit the length of the request chain, which is useful for
   testing a chain of proxies forwarding messages in an infinite loop.



\subsection{Response Status Codes} 
The status-code element is a three-digit integer code giving the
   result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request.

   HTTP status codes are extensible.  HTTP clients are not required to
   understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
   understanding is obviously desirable.  However, a client MUST
   understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
   digit, and treat an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to
   the x00 status code of that class, with the exception that a
   recipient MUST NOT cache a response with an unrecognized status code.

   For example, if an unrecognized status code of 471 is received by a
   client, the client can assume that there was something wrong with its
   request and treat the response as if it had received a 400 (Bad
   Request) status code.  The response message will usually contain a
   representation that explains the status.

   The first digit of the status-code defines the class of response.
   The last two digits do not have any categorization role.  There are
   five values for the first digit:

   o  1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process

   o  2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received,
      understood, and accepted

   o  3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to
      complete the request

   o  4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be
      fulfilled
      o  5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently
      valid request

\subsection{Overview of Status Codes}

   The status codes listed below are defined in this specification,
   Section 4 of [RFC7232], Section 4 of [RFC7233], and Section 3 of
   [RFC7235].  The reason phrases listed here are only recommendations
   -- they can be replaced by local equivalents without affecting the
   protocol.

   Responses with status codes that are defined as cacheable by default
   (e.g., 200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, and 501 in
   this specification) can be reused by a cache with heuristic
   expiration unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or
   explicit cache controls [RFC7234]; all other status codes are not
   cacheable by default.

\end{longtable}

   
   
   \subsubsection{Informational 1xx}

   The 1xx (Informational) class of status code indicates an interim
   response for communicating connection status or request progress
   prior to completing the requested action and sending a final
   response. 1xx responses are terminated by the first empty line after
   the status-line (the empty line signaling the end of the header
   section).  Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, a
   server MUST NOT send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client.

  


   \subsubsection{Successful 2xx}

   The 2xx (Successful) class of status code indicates that the client's
   request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.



   \subsubsection{Redirection 3xx}

   The 3xx (Redirection) class of status code indicates that further
   action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the
   request.  If a Location header field (Section 7.1.2) is provided, the
   user agent MAY automatically redirect its request to the URI
   referenced by the Location field value, even if the specific status
   code is not understood.  Automatic redirection needs to done with
   care for methods not known to be safe, as defined in Section 4.2.1,
   since the user might not wish to redirect an unsafe request.

   There are several types of redirects:

   1.  Redirects that indicate the resource might be available at a
       different URI, as provided by the Location field, as in the
       status codes 301 (Moved Permanently), 302 (Found), and 307
       (Temporary Redirect).

   2.  Redirection that offers a choice of matching resources, each
       capable of representing the original request target, as in the
       300 (Multiple Choices) status code.

   3.  Redirection to a different resource, identified by the Location
       field, that can represent an indirect response to the request, as
       in the 303 (See Other) status code.

   4.  Redirection to a previously cached result, as in the 304 (Not
       Modified) status code.



\subsubsection{Client Error 4xx}

   The 4xx (Client Error) class of status code indicates that the client
   seems to have erred.  Except when responding to a HEAD request, the
   server SHOULD send a representation containing an explanation of the
   error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent
   condition.  These status codes are applicable to any request method.
   User agents SHOULD display any included representation to the user.




\subsubsection{Server Error 5xx}

   The 5xx (Server Error) class of status code indicates that the server
   is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the
   requested method.  Except when responding to a HEAD request, the
   server SHOULD send a representation containing an explanation of the
   error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent   condition.  A user agent SHOULD display any included representation
   to the user.  These response codes are applicable to any request
   method.

  

\subsection{HTTPS con SSL} 

With an understanding of some of the key concepts of cryptography,
we can now look closely at the operation of the Secure Sockets Layer
(ssl) protocol. Although ssl is not an extremely complicated protocol, it does offer several options and variations. This chapter explains
ssl by starting with the simplest case: establishing an encrypted
communications channel. It then considers successively more complex options, including authenticating the communicating parties,
separating encryption from authentication, and resuming a previously
established session. Within these sections, you will discover the full
power of ssl.
The ssl protocol consists of a set of messages and rules about when
to send (and not to send) each one. In this chapter, we consider what
those messages are, the general information they contain, and how
systems use the different messages in a communications session. We
do not, however, explore the detailed message formats: the bits and
bytes that make up ssl messages as they transit across a network.
That detail is the subject of chapter 4. Neither do we spend time here
on the detailed cryptographic computations ssl requires; those, too,
are a topic for the next chapter. This chapter concentrates on the big
picture. The details will be much easier to understand once you have
an appreciation of the overall operation of the Secure Sockets Layer.

\subsubsection{SSL Roles}
The Secure Sockets Layer protocol defines two different roles for the
communicating parties. One system is always a client, while the other
is a server. The distinction is very important, because ssl requires the
two systems to behave very differently. The client is the system that
initiates the secure communications; the server responds to the clientâs request. In the most common use of ssl, secure Web browsing,
the Web browser is the ssl client and the Web site is the ssl server.
These same two roles apply to all applications that use ssl, and the
examples in this chapter (indeed, throughout the book) will clearly
distinguish them.
For ssl itself, the most important distinctions between clients and
servers are their actions during the negotiation of security parameters. Since the client initiates a communication, it has the
responsibility of proposing a set of ssl options to use for the
exchange. The server selects from the clientâs proposed options,
deciding what the two systems will actually use. Although the final
decision rests with the server, the server can only choose from among
those options that the client originally proposed.

\subsubsection{SSL Messages}
When ssl clients and servers communicate, they do so by exchanging ssl messages. Technically, ssl defines different levels of messages,
but that topic is best left for Chapter 4. Since this chapter concentrates strictly on functionality, distinguishing between the various ssl
levels is not critical. Table 3-1 lists the ssl messages at all levels of the
protocol, in alphabetical order. The remaining sections in this chapter
show how systems use these messages in their communications.
Table 3-1 SSL Messages
Message Description
Alert Informs the other party of a possible security
breach or communication failure.
ApplicationData Actual information that the two parties exchange, which is encrypted, authenticated,
and/or verified by SSL.
Certificate A message that carries the senderâs public key
certificate.
CertificateRequest A request by the server that the client provide
its public key certificate.
CertificateVerify A message from the client that verifies that it
knows the private key corresponding to its public key certificate.
ChangeCipherSpec An indication to begin using agreed-upon security services (such as encryption).
ClientHello A message from the client indicating the security services it desires and is capable of supporting.
ClientKeyExchange A message from the client carrying cryptographic keys for the communications.
Finished An indication that all initial negotiations are
complete and secure communications have
been established.
HelloRequest A request by the server that the client start (or
restart) the SSL negotiation process.
ServerHello A message from the server indicating the security services that will be used for the communications.
ServerHelloDone An indication from the server that it has completed all its requests of the client for establishing communications.
ServerKeyExchange A message from the server carrying cryptographic keys for the communications.

\subsubsection{Establishing Encrypted Communications}
The most basic function that an ssl client and server can perform is
establishing a channel for encrypted communications. Figure 3-1
shows the ssl message exchange this operation requires, and table 3-2
summarizes the steps in the figure. This section looks at these steps
in more detail by considering each message in the exchange.

GRAFIQUITO

\paragraph{ClientHello}
The ClientHello message starts the ssl communication between the
two parties. The client uses this message to ask the server to begin
negotiating security services by using ssl. Table 3-3 lists the important components of a ClientHello message.
Table 3-3 ClientHello Components
Field Use
Version Identifies the highest version of the SSL protocol that the client can support.
RandomNumber A 32-byte random number used to seed the
cryptographic calculations.
SessionID Identifies a specific SSL session.
CipherSuites A list of cryptographic parameters that the client can support.
CompressionMethods
Identifies data compression methods that the
client can support.
The Version field of the ClientHello message contains the highest
version number of ssl that the client can support. The current ssl
version is 3.0, and it is by far the most widely deployed on the Internet. (But see the sidebar for information on t ls.) Note that a server
may assume that the client can support all ssl versions up to and including the value of this field. If, for example, a client sends a version
3.0 ClientHello to a server that only supports version 2.0 of ssl, the
server may respond with version 2.0 messages that it expects the client to understand. In such cases, that client can decide to continue
with the ssl session using version 2.0 functionality, or it can abandon

the communication attempt. Section 5.1 includes additional information about compatibility with previous versions.
The RandomNumber field, as you might expect, contains a random
number. This random value, along with a similar random value that
the server creates, provides the seed for critical cryptographic calculations. Chapter 4 has the details. The ssl specification suggests that
four of this fieldâs 32 bytes consist of the time and date. The ssl protocol does not require a particular level of accuracy for this value, as it
is not intended to provide an accurate time indication. Instead, the
specification suggests using the date and time as a way to ensure that
the client never uses the same random value twice. This precaution
protects against an impostor copying old ssl messages from a legitimate client and reusing them to establish a counterfeit session.
The remaining 28 bytes of this value should be a âcryptographically
secureâ random number. Security is not something we ordinarily associate with randomness, but it is important in this case. Most computer programs use a technique known as pseudorandom number
generation to create random numbers. When used correctly, this approach does yield numbers that have the appearance of randomness.
However, the technique does have a serious flaw when used in a security context: if an attacker knows the exact algorithm and one random value, that attacker can correctly predict all future random
values. This knowledge might allow the attacker to anticipate a particular future value and prepare an attack against it. To prevent this
type of attack, ssl implementations should use a different technique
for generating random numbers; typically, they use one based on
cryptographic algorithms.
The next field in the ClientHello message is SessionID. Although all
ClientHello messages may include this field, in this example, the
field is meaningless and would be empty. Section 3.8 presents an example of how the SessionID field may be used.
The CipherSuites field allows a client to list the various cryptographic
services that the client can support, including exact algorithms and
key sizes. The server actually makes the final decision as to which
cryptographic services will be used for the communication, but it is

limited to choosing from this list. Chapter 4 describes the format of
this field in detail, including the various algorithms and key size options that ssl defines.
The CompressionMethods field is, in theory, similar to the CipherSuites field. In it, the client may list all of the various data compression methods that it can support. Compression methods are an
important part of ssl because encryption has significant consequences on the effectiveness of any data compression techniques. Encryption changes the mathematical properties of information in a
way that makes data compression virtually impossible. In fact, if it
were possible to compress encrypted data, that would likely indicate a
security weakness in the encryption algorithm. For this reason, if two
parties are going to employ data compression for a communication, it
is important that they compress their data before encrypting it. The
ssl protocol accommodates this behavior by including the capacity
for data compression, and by making sure that the compression occurs before encryption. In the current version of ssl, however, no actual compression methods have been defined. This field, therefore,
currently is of limited use. In the future, additional compression
methods may be defined and added to the t ls (but not ssl) specifications.
\subsubsection{ServerHello}
When the server receives the ClientHello message, it responds with a
ServerHello. As table 3-4 shows, the contents of a ServerHello are
much the same as a ClientHello. There are a few important differences, though, which weâll examine in this subsection. In general,
where the client makes suggestions in its ClientHello message, the
server makes the final decision in its ServerHello.
The Version field is the first example of a server making a final decision for the communications. The ClientHelloâs version simply identifies which ssl versions the client can support. The ServerHelloâs
version, on the other hand, determines the ssl version that the communication will use. A server is not completely free to choose any ssl
version, however; it cannot pick a version newer than the latest that
the client can support. If the client does not like the serverâs choice, it
may abandon the communication. As of this writing, nearly all ssl
clients and servers support version 3.0 of the ssl protocol.
The RandomNumber field of the ServerHello is essentially the same
as in the ClientHello, though this random value is chosen by the
server. Along with the clientâs value, this number seeds important
cryptographic calculations. The serverâs value does share the same
properties as in the ClientHello. Four of the 32 bytes are the date and
time (to avoid repeating random values); the remaining bytes should
be created by a cryptographically secure random number generator.
The SessionID field of a ServerHello may contain a value, unlike the
ClientHelloâs field just discussed. The value in this case uniquely
identifies this particular ssl communication, or session. The main reason for explicitly identifying a particular ssl session is to refer to it
again later. Section 3.8 shows an example of how a client can use this
facility to speed up the ssl negotiation process. If the server does not
intend the session to ever be reused, it can omit the SessionID field
from its ServerHello message.
The CipherSuite field (note that the name is singular, not plural, as in
the case of a ClientHello) determines the exact cryptographic parameters, specifically algorithms and key sizes, to be used for the session. The server must select a single cipher suite from among those
listed by the client in its ClientHello message.

The CompressionMethod field is also singular for a ServerHello. In
theory, the server uses this field to identify the data compression to
be used for the session. Again, the server must pick from among
those listed in the ClientHello. Current ssl versions have not defined
any compression methods, however, so this field has no practical utility.
\subsubsection{ServerKeyExchange}
In this example, the server follows its ServerHello message with a
ServerKeyExchange message. This message complements the CipherSuite field of the ServerHello. While the CipherSuite field indicates
the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes, this message contains the
public key information itself. The exact format of the key information depends on the particular public key algorithm used. For the rsa
algorithm, for example, the server includes the modulus and public
exponent of the serverâs rsa public key.
Note that the ServerKeyExchange message is transmitted without
encryption, so that only public key information can be safely included within it. The client will use the serverâs public key to encrypt
a session key, which the parties will use to actually encrypt the application data for the session.
3.3.4 ServerHelloDone
The ServerHelloDone message tells the client that the server has finished with its initial negotiation messages. The message itself contains no other information, but it is important to the client, because
once the client receives a ServerHelloDone, it can move to the next
phase of establishing the secure communications.
3.3.5 ClientKeyExchange
When the server has finished its part of the initial ssl negotiation,
the client responds with a ClientKeyExchange message. Just as the
ServerKeyExchange provides the key information for the server, the
ClientKeyExchange tells the server the clientâs key information. In

this case, however, the key information is for the symmetric encryption algorithm both parties will use for the session. Furthermore, the
information in the clientâs message is encrypted using the public key
of the server. This encryption protects the key information as it traverses the network, and it allows the client to verify that the server
truly possesses the private key corresponding to its public key. Otherwise, the server wonât be able to decrypt this message. This operation is an important protection against an attacker that intercepts
messages from a legitimate server and pretends to be that server by
forwarding the messages to an unsuspecting client. Since a fake
server wonât know the real serverâs private key, it wonât be able to decrypt the ClientKeyExchange message. Without the information in
that message, communication between the two parties cannot succeed.
3.3.6 ChangeCipherSpec
After the client sends key information in a ClientKeyExchange message, the preliminary ssl negotiation is complete. At that point, the
parties are ready to begin using the security services they have negotiated. The ssl protocol defines a special messageâ
ChangeCipherSpecâto explicitly indicate that the security services
should now be invoked.
Since the transition to secured communication is critical, and both
parties have to get it exactly right, the ssl specification is very precise
in describing the process. First, it identifies the set of information
that defines security services. That information includes a specific
symmetric encryption algorithm, a specific message integrity algorithm, and specific key material for those algorithms. The ssl specification also recognizes that some of that information (in particular,
the key material) will be different for each direction of communication. In other words, one set of keys will secure data the client sends
to the server, and a different set of keys will secure data the server
sends to the client. (In principle, the actual algorithms could differ as
well, but ssl does not define a way to negotiate such an option.) For
any given system, whether it is a client or a server, ssl defines a write
state and a read state. The write state defines the security information

for data that the system sends, and the read state defines the security
information for data that the system receives.
The ChangeCipherSpec message serves as the cue for a system to
begin using its security information. Before a client or server sends a
ChangeCipherSpec message, it must know the complete security information it is about to activate. As soon as the system sends this
message, it activates its write state. Similarly, as soon as a system receives a ChangeCipherSpec from its peer, the system activates its
read state. Figures 3-2 and 3-3 illustrate this process in more detail.
The first shows how the client views the process, while the second
takes the serverâs perspective.
In both figures, the matrices on the side show the systemsâ read and
write states. The events shown in black (as opposed to gray) cause
the systems to update their states. As the figures indicate, ssl actually
defines two separate read and write states for each system. One of
the states is active and the second is pending. Both the client and the
server, therefore, maintain a total of four different states: the active
write state, the pending write state, the active read state, and the
pending read state. (The figures use the abbreviations âActâ and
âPndâ for active and pending, respectively.)
The figures also show the key elements of a state. They are the encryption algorithm (abbreviated âEncrâ), the message integrity algorithm (abbreviated âmacâ for Message Authentication Code), and
the key material. In figures 3-2 and 3-3, the systems agree to use the
Data Encryption Standard (des) for symmetric encryption and Message Digest 5 (md5) for message integrity.
As the figures show, all systems start out in active states with no security services whatsoever. This initial condition is necessary for the
systems to begin any communication; until they have negotiated security services and parameters, secure communication is not possible.
As the systems exchange ssl messages, they begin building the pending state. First they agree on encryption and message integrity algorithms, then they exchange key information. Only then, when both
the client and the server have full pending states, can the systems activate those pending states with ChangeCipherSpec messages.
Table 3-5 details the client processing that figure 3-2 illustrates. It describes the steps in the figure that are shown in solid black; those are
the steps that result in a change of the clientâs states.
Notice from the figures that one systemâs active write state is the
same as the other systemâs active read stateâwith one exception. The
exception occurs during the transmission of a ChangeCipherSpec
message. As soon as one system sends this message, it updates its active states. The other system, however, does not change its active
states until it receives the message. In the interim, the two systems
are temporarily out of synchronization.
\subsubsection{Finished}
Immediately after sending their ChangeCipherSpec messages, each
system also sends a Finished message. The Finished messages allow
both systems to verify that the negotiation has been successful and
that security has not been compromised. Two aspects of the Finished
message contribute to this security. First, as the previous subsection
explained, the Finished message itself is subject to the negotiated cipher suite. That means that it is encrypted and authenticated according to that suite. If the receiving party cannot successfully decrypt
and verify the message, then clearly something has gone awry with
the security negotiation.
The contents of the Finished message also serve to protect the security of the ssl negotiation. Each Finished message contains a cryptographic hash of important information about the just-finished
negotiation. Table 3-7 details the information that is secured by the
hash. Notice that protected data includes the exact content of all
handshake messages used in the exchange (though ChangeCipherSpec messages are not considered âhandshakeâ messages in the strict
sense of the word, and thus are not included). This protects against
an attacker who manages to insert fictitious messages or remove legitimate messages from the communication. If an attacker were able
to do so, the clientâs and serverâs hash calculations would not match,
and they would detect the compromise. Chapter 4 describes the details of the hash calculation.

\subsubsection{Ending Secure Communications}
Although as a practical matter it is rarely used (primarily due to the
nature of Web sessions), ssl does have a defined procedure for ending a secure communication between two parties. As figure 3-4
shows, the two systems each send a special ClosureAlert to the other.
Explicitly closing a session protects against a truncation attack, in
which an attacker is able to compromise security by prematurely terminating a communication. Imagine, for example, that an attacker
was able to delete just the second phrase of the following sentence:
âPlease destroy all the documents, unless you hear from me tomorrow.â The ClosureAlert message helps systems detect such attacks. If
a system received the message âPlease destroy all documentsâ but did
not receive a ClosureAlert, it would recognize that the complete
message may not have arrived. As mentioned, it is not always possible to receive ClosureAlert messages reliably for Web transactions.
Appendix b describes other steps Web servers and clients can take to
protect against these truncation attacks.
\subsubsection{Authenticating the Serverâs Identity}
Although section 3.4 explained how ssl can establish encrypted
communications between two parties, that may not really add that
much security to the communication. With encryption alone neither

party can really be sure of the otherâs identity. The typical reason for
using encryption in the first place is to keep information secret from
some third party. But if that third party were able to successfully
masquerade as the intended recipient of the information, then encryption would serve no purpose. The data would be encrypted, but
the attacker would have all the data necessary to decrypt it.
To avoid this type of attack, ssl includes mechanisms that allow each
party to authenticate the identity of the other. With these mechanisms, each party can be sure that the other is genuine, and not a
masquerading attacker. In this section, weâll look at how ssl enables a
server to authenticate itself.
A natural question is, of course, if authenticating identities is so important, why donât we always authenticate both parties? The answer
lies in the nature of Web commerce. When you want to purchase
something using your Web browser, itâs very important that the Web
site youâre browsing is authentic. You wouldnât want to send your
credit card number to some imposter posing as your favorite merchant. The merchant, on the other hand, has other means for
authenticating your identity. Once it receives a credit card number,
for example, it can validate that number. Since the server doesnât
need ssl to authenticate your identity, the ssl protocol allows for
server authentication only. (The protocol does define a process for
authenticating clients. Section 3.7. discusses that process.)
Table 3-8 summarizes the actions each system takes to authenticate a
server. The same steps are shown graphically in figure 3-5. The process isnât all that different from simple encryption. (Compare figure
3-5 with figure 3-1.) The two messages in black are different when authenticating a server. Those messages, the Certificate message and
the ClientKeyExchange message, are discussed next. All other messages are the same as described in section 3.3

\paragraph{Certificate}
When authenticating its identity, the server sends a Certificate message instead of the ServerKeyExchange message section 3.3.3 described. The Certificate message simply contains a certificate chain
that begins with the serverâs public key certificate and ends with the
certificate authorityâs root certificate.
The client has the responsibility to make sure it can trust the certificate it receives from the server. That responsibility includes verifying
the certificate signatures, validity times, and revocation status. It also
means ensuring that the certificate authority is one that the client
trusts. Typically, clients make this determination by knowing the
public key of trusted certificate authorities in advance, through some
trusted means. Netscape and Microsoft, for example, preload their
browser software with public keys for well-known certificate authorities. Web servers that want to rely on this trust mechanism can only
obtain their certificates (at least indirectly) from one of these wellknown authorities.
One additional detail in the certificate verification process can sometimes seem subtle, but is nonetheless crucial for real security: The client must ensure not only that the certificate is issued by a trusted
authority, but that the certificate also unambiguously identifies the
party with whom it wants to communicate. Consider, for example, a
malicious company that receives a legitimate certificate from a
trusted certificate authority under its own name, but then turns
around and uses that certificate illegitimately to masquerade as a
competitor. The unsuspecting client that communicates with this
malicious company (believing that it is communicating with the
competitor) will receive a legitimate certificate as part of the ssl exchange. The client, however, must be intelligent enough to detect
that the certificate does not belong to the real competitor. For Web
commerce, the key to solving this problem normally relies on the
domain name of the server. Respected certificate authorities include
the Internet domain name of the Web server in the certificates they
issue. And Web browsers check the domain name in certificates they
receive against the domain name their users attempt to contact. If,
for example, a browser tries to connect to www.goodcompany.com
and receives a certificate for www.badcompany.com, the browser
knows something is amiss no matter how valid the certificate otherwise appears. Appendix b contains additional information on verifying certificates.
\paragraph{ClientKeyExchange}
The clientâs ClientKeyExchange message also differs in server authentication, though the difference is not major. When encryption
only is to be used, the client encrypts the information in the ClientKeyExchange using the public key the server provides in its
ServerKeyExchange message. In this case, of course, the server is authenticating itself and, thus, has sent a Certificate message instead of
a ServerKeyExchange. The client, therefore, encrypts its ClientKeyExchange information using the public key contained in the
serverâs certificate. This step is important because it allows the client
to make sure that the party with whom it is communicating actually
possesses the serverâs private key. Only a system with the actual private key will be able to decrypt this message and successfully continue the communication.
3.6 Separating Encryption from Authentication
The previous section explained how a server can send a Certificate
message instead of a ServerKeyExchange message to authenticate itself. One consequence of this approach is that the same public key
information used to verify the serverâs identity is also used to encrypt
key material in the clientâs ClientKeyExchange message. This constraint is not always desirable; indeed, in some cases it is actually impossible to support.
The impossible cases are easiest to describe. Some public key algorithms (such as the Digital Signature Algorithm) can only be used
for signing. By their very design, they cannot be used for encryption.
In such cases, it will be impossible for the client to encrypt its ClientKeyExchange information using the serverâs public key

This limitation alone would be sufficient to require greater flexibility
from the ssl protocol, but it is worthwhile to understand why combining signing and encryption might be undesirable, even when the
public key algorithm supports both operations. The most common
reason for separating encryption from signing is based not on technical considerations, but on legal ones. Some countries, including important producers of cryptographic products such as the United
States (at least at the time of this writing), control the use or the export of products that include cryptography. In particular, the United
States makes it more difficult for suppliers to export cryptographic
products that use encryption key lengths greater than a certain
minimum. (Key lengths less than or equal to these limits are said to

be exportable.) In principle, at least, the United States does not impose the same restrictions on keys used for digital signatures. Systems
that fall under u.s. jurisdiction, therefore, may prefer to use the longest practical keys for authenticating their identity (thus providing the
strongest practical authentication), but use encryption keys that conform to the weaker export restrictions.
Whatever the reason, ssl does provide a mechanism for separating
server authentication from the encryption. Table 3-9 outlines the
steps involved, and figure 3-6 illustrates the entire process. The figure
highlights the three messages that are significant for separating encryption and server authentication. They are the Certificate,
ServerKeyExchange, and ClientKeyExchange messages.

\paragraph{Certificate}
The Certificate message in this example is identical to the example
in section 3.5, except that the public key in the serverâs certificate will
only be used to verify its identity. The client still has all the responsibilities section 3.5.1 discussed, however. It must verify the certificateâs
signatures, validity times, and revocation status, and it must ensure
that the certificate authority is trusted, and that the certificate was issued to the party with whom it wishes to communicate.
\paragraph{ServerKeyExchange}
The server follows its Certificate message with a ServerKeyExchange
message. It is this second message that contains the public key the
client should use to encrypt session key information. The
ServerKeyExchange is the same message that we saw when no authentication was involved, and the information contained in the message is the same as described in section 3.3.3âwith one significant
difference: Unlike the example of section 3.3, in which the server keys
were sent by themselves, in this scenario, the key information is
signed using the public key contained in the serverâs certificate. This
step is essential to give the client a way to verify that the server really
does possess the private key corresponding to its public key certificate.
\paragraph{ClientKeyExchange}
The client uses a ClientKeyExchange message to finish the negotiation process, just as it does in other scenarios. As before, this message
contains the key information for the symmetric encryption algorithm
the two parties have selected. Also as before, this information is encrypted using the serverâs public key. It is important to note that the
public key used for this encryption is the public key from the
ServerKeyExchange message, not the public key from the serverâs
Certificate message (even if that public key algorithm supports encryption)
